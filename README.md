Ling for Geometry
=================

This is the source code base for my Bachlor Thesis Project at Hochschule Furtwangen University.

**Please note this:**
	- There is no compileable state right now  
	- You might read the code but you must not copy or redistribute it until i set the licence for this  
	- You can ask me questions via github  
	- I might change a lot during the developing process  
	- There is no guarantee i will finish this project 100% of its aim  
	- There will be some UML diagrams etc in the future  
	- Perhaps there will be a little blog - not sure  
	- All changes will be described in the commit messages
